# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
This project is an attempt to analyze cryptocurrencies on the trading market to see how they could be grouped to create a classification system for potential new investment.

## Approach
K-Means clustering algorithm will be used to group the crpytocurrencies. Data will be pre-processed to fit this algorithm including encoding categrical data and applying PCA to determine 3 top principal components. Elbow curve will be utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters and the results will be visualized in 2D and 3D using Plotly Express and hvplot libraries.
